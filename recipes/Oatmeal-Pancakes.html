<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul id="one">
  <li> 1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats</li>
  <li>1 cup milk, regular or non-dairy</li>
  <li>2 large eggs</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, plus more for cooking</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
  <li>2/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Whisk 1 cup rolled oats and 1 cup milk together in a large bowl. Let stand for 10 minutes for the oats to soften.</li>
  <li>Add warm butter, 2 eggs, and 1 tablespoon granulated sugar to the oats, and whisk to combine. Add 2/3 cup all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, and whisk until just combined; do not overmix. Let stand for 5 minutes more. Meanwhile, heat a large cast iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
  <li>Add 1 teaspoon butter to the pan and swirl to coat.</li>
  <li>Drop the batter into the pan in 2-tablespoon portions, cooking 3 at a time.</li>
  <li>Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, the edges begin to look dry, and the bottoms are golden-brown, about 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Flip the pancakes and cook until the other side is golden-brown, 2 to 3 minutes more.</li>
  <li>Transfer the pancakes to a warm oven or plate. Repeat cooking the remaining batter, using 1 teaspoon butter for each batch.</li>
